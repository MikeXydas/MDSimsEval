# MD Feature Extraction and Evaluation

**MD_Feature_Extraction** is a package I created as part of my undergraduate thesis that in a flexible way calculates useful
metrics from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, stores them and provides a number of methods for useful visualizations
and feature evaluation.
