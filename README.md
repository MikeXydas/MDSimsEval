# MD Feature Extraction and Evaluation

**MDSimsEval** is a package I created as part of my undergraduate thesis that in a flexible way calculates useful
metrics from a collection of two classes of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations (eg agonists vs antagonists), 
stores them and provides a number of methods for understanding their discriminative ability.
